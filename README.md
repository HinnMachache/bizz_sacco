BIZZ_SACCO:
This is my end year portfolio project.
Decription:
The Project system aims to assistance local groups, SACCOS; locally known as 'Chamas'
in managing their funds.
The Sacco groups would consist of a number of people, who would normally save their money(invest)
in a one bank account. This would guarantee the members in being given loans based on the money
saved in the bank account.
This is a fater way of helping bussiness owners of getting loans almost instantly and without
much ytouble as banks. The systems also monitors trends in a bussiness depending on the moeny deposited.

TECHNOLOGIES:
Front-End : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-End : Flask-Python
